# all_in_one_pipeline

## Getting Started
This repository is a compilation of tools commonly used in BDRD NMRC lab. This was developed to easily created customized workflows for commonly used tools. Prebuilt workflows exist for qc stats and Metadetector/Virusseeker (MD-VS). Inside of the SOP directory are instructions on how to run the existing pipelines. To build new customized workflows use the existing ones as templates.
